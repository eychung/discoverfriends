DiscoverFriends
===============
The goal of this application is to achieve secure communication to a group of online friends under a mobile ad hoc network environment.

Features
--------
1. **Bloom filters**: provide a space-efficient means of security for friend discovery.
2. **Hybrid encryption technique**: combines asymmetric and symmetric encryptions algorithms in order to utilize the benefits of increased security at lower computational cost.
3. **Self-organized public-key management scheme**: helps authenticate users using a trust graph in an infrastructureless setting.

With the use of Wi-Fi Direct technology, the user is able to establish an ad hoc network where friends can connect to within the application.
